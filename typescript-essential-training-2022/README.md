## What is typescript?
    - JavaScript is a widely-used language that's been around for several decades and is used in many applications.
    - JavaScript's dynamic nature allows for easy variable definition and manipulation, but also increases the risk of errors.
    - TypeScript is a language that adds strong static typing on top of JavaScript.
    - TypeScript catches common issues before code is run, provides in-line documentation and guidance, and is a superset of JavaScript.
    - TypeScript code can be compiled down to JavaScript, so it can be used anywhere JavaScript is used.
    - If you know JavaScript, you're already on your way to knowing TypeScript.   

## Technologies Used:
    - `npm i -D typescript ts-node`
    - add configuration in tsconfig.json to output to es6 to `build` folder
    - use command `npm run build` which will run `tsc` command
    - in tsconfig.json you can use `esnext`  to use latest typescript, can use `noEmit: true` to avoid outputting anything
